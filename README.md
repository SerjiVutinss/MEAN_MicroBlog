## Server

Rename database.sample.js to database.js and enter Mongo/mLab connection string in `database` export.

`npm install` and then `npm start` or `npm run start` will run the server

`npm run dev` will run the server with live reload - ensure nodemon is installed globally (`npm install -g nodemon`)

## Client
`cd client`, `npm install` then `npm start` to run

Note: Since proxying is used, `ng serve` will run the application incorrectly
